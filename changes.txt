Differences in 1.20151027.1
===========================
HotStrings
    - NEW   : Added "@me" to use the new variable MY_NAME
    - NEW   : Added "@sig" to use the new variable MY_SIGNATURE
    - CHANGE: Internal changes to "@ip" to allow it to be easily overridden with a custom function
    - NEW   : Added "#/#%", which divides two numbers and returns the result as a percent
    - NEW   : Added "#%#", which returns the percentage of the first number in relation to the second number
    - NEW   : Added "lmk"
    - NEW   : Added "vg"
Variables
    - NEW   : Added MY_NAME
    - NEW   : Added MY_SIGNATURE
Miscellaneous
    - CHANGE: Added missing reference to "@#" hotstring on the help screen
    - CHANGE: Minor internal changes to how the headers of the HotScript-*.ahk include scripts are written
    - CHANGE: Added additional information to the headers of HotScript-Strings.ahk to include dynamic hotstrings
    - REMOVE: GetKeyState() because it now conflicts with AutoHotKey's internal function with the same name
    - REMOVE: getHotKeySections() because it was an obsolete function from a very old version
    - CHANGE: Minor change within hotString() to call addHotString() only if any conditional function returns true
    - CHANGE: Minor renaming of variables and optimization within hotString()
    - CHANGE: Added a "." to the end of some of the aliases on the help screen to signify that an ending character is needed

Differences in 1.20151018.1
===========================
- Added configuration flag to disabling auto-updates (auto-update is on by default - may be disabled via enableAutoUpdate in the INI).
- Added ability to create an auto-startup link (may be disabled via enableAutoStart in the INI)
- Fixed issue with ask() returning any value entered even if the user closed dialog, click cancel or pressed Escape
- Removed warning message about being unable to obtain version information if an internet connection is not available at startup
- Made changes that may have finally corrected intermittent issues with pasting text to a DOS window
- Swapped Win-6 and Win-8 to allow Win-8 and Win-9 to be next grouped together
- Added new functions:
    - isDirectory()
    - isFile()
    - isUNC()
- Added smarter control to Win-G to allow running of files/directories (if they exist) or UNC paths
- Added hotkey to launch the HotScript homepage (Win-0)
- Added menu item to launch the HotScript homepage from the system tray icon
- Fixed a known limitation of being unable to use a tab as an ending character to a dynamic hotstring
    - This was only an issue for hotstrings that would be replaced (rather than just appending text)
    - Because some editors can be configured to insert (a variable number of) spaces instead of a tab, it
      was not easily knowable how much backspacing was required in order to erase the trigger string.
    - While this is slightly slower than normal now (only when using a tab), it is working correctly.
        - The reason for it being slow is that the text entered must be selected one character at a time
          until the start of the trigger can be found.
- Removed unwanted menu items from the system tray icon
- Added status (enabled or suspended) to system tray icon tooltip
- Delete downloaded installer after upgrading
- Added new global variable (defined in HotScriptVariables.ahk)
    - MY_PHONE        (trigger by the hotstring "@#")
        - This will need to be added manually (by the user - you!) until I can determine a way of SAFELY adding it to existing files

Differences in 1.20150907.1
===========================
