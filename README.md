## TODO

Documentation is continuously being enhanced but is lagging behind the actual development of HotScript. We know it is important and are working on it. The current User Manual is very outdated and will be replaced with a full wiki describing every feature of HotScript and will include a fully documented API. Please check the forum for updates.

### Roadmap 
HotScript is always growing. The wishlist is huge, containing several hundred new features.
