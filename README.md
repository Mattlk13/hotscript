## Status

Documentation is being enhanced but is lagging behind the actual development of HotScript. We know it is important and are working on it. The current [user manual](UserManual.md) is outdated and will be replaced with a full wiki describing every feature of HotScript and will also include a fully documented API. Please check the forum for updates.

### Roadmap 
HotScript is continuously growing. The wishlist is huge, containing several hundred new features. 

## Donate

Please consider donating towards the future development and support of HotScript.

Donations are the best way to request new features or increase the priority of a planned enhancement.
